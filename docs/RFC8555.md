RFC8555.md

# Overview
   o  The operator's ACME client prompts the operator for the intended
      domain name(s) that the web server is to stand for.

   o  The ACME client presents the operator with a list of CAs from
      which it could get a certificate.  (This list will change over
      time based on the capabilities of CAs and updates to ACME
      configuration.)  The ACME client might prompt the operator for
      payment information at this point.

   o  The operator selects a CA.

   o  In the background, the ACME client contacts the CA and requests
      that it issue a certificate for the intended domain name(s).

   o  The CA verifies that the client controls the requested domain
      name(s) by having the ACME client perform some action(s) that can
      only be done with control of the domain name(s).  For example, the
      CA might require a client requesting example.com to provision a
      DNS record under example.com or an HTTP resource under
      http://example.com.

   o  Once the CA is satisfied, it issues the certificate and the ACME
      client automatically downloads and installs it, potentially
      notifying the operator via email, SMS, etc.

   o  The ACME client periodically contacts the CA to get updated
      certificates, stapled Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
      responses [RFC6960], or whatever else would be required to keep
      the web server functional and its credentials up to date.

# key
   An ACME client authenticates to the server by means of an "account
   key pair".  The client uses the private key of this key pair to sign
   all messages sent to the server.  The server uses the public key to
   verify the authenticity and integrity of messages from the client.

# message transport
Communications between an ACME client and an ACME server are done
over HTTPS, using JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] to provide some
additional security properties for messages sent from the client to
the server.  HTTPS provides server authentication and
confidentiality.  With some ACME-specific extensions, JWS provides
authentication of the client's request payloads, anti-replay
protection, and integrity for the HTTPS request URL.
